    <h1>Campaign Overview: Dexter’s Dimensional Dilemma</h1>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Core Theme & Finale</h2>
        <p>The aliens seek to exploit humanity’s fluid individuality to bridge into other dimensions. The more fractured and fluid, the easier it is for them to slip through. The finale centers on the 1983 false alarm: a moment of trust across divides, where the players must prevent the alien from exploiting that fracture in time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Arcs & Dimensions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alien Arc:</strong> Investigate the death of Darnell Mantell; stop the alien from using emotional fluidity to open dimensional pathways.</li>
            <li><strong>Demon Arc:</strong> Discover vertical dimensions (heaven/hell metaphor); prevent alliances with Cold War agents from destabilizing reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptid Arc:</strong> Native American legends reveal that the Thunderbird guards dimensional balance. Players must align with protective forces.</li>
            <li><strong>Cold War Arc:</strong> Players encounter U.S. agents and Russian operatives. The Russians, allied with demons, seek to exploit the disunity. The players must foster trust at the critical historical moment.</li>
        </ul>
