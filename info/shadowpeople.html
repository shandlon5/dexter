    <h1>Shadow People</h1>

    <p>
        Shadow People are dark, humanoid figures seen at the edges of vision, often vanishing when looked at directly.
        Reports of these beings span centuries and cultures, commonly associated with fear, paralysis, and a sense of being watched.
    </p>

    <h2>Ancient Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        Folklore across the world tells of dark spirits that lurk between light and darkness.
        Some believed they were omens of tragedy, while others claimed they were watchers from another realm.
    </p>

    <h2>Modern Sightings</h2>
    <p>
        In more recent decades, people report tall shadow figures standing in doorways, hallways,
        or desert roads — sometimes wearing what appears to be a wide-brimmed hat.
    </p>

    <h2>Behavior and Patterns</h2>
    <p>
        Witnesses say Shadow People rarely speak but often move with unnatural speed.
        Their presence is frequently accompanied by a heavy feeling in the air or sudden drops in temperature.
    </p>

    <h2>Theories</h2>
    <p>
        Some believe Shadow People are spirits of the dead, while others think they are interdimensional beings
        slipping into our world through unknown means.
