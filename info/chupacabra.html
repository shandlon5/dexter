    <h1>The Chupacabra</h1>

    <p>
        The Chupacabra is a mysterious predator whispered about across the Southwest and Latin America,
        blamed for livestock found drained of blood and bearing strange puncture wounds.
        Its name roughly translates to “goat sucker,” though reports describe many victims.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Sightings</h2>
    <p>
        Modern legends of the Chupacabra surged in the late 20th century, though similar creatures appear
        in older folklore. Ranchers told of shadows moving between pens at night, followed by silent killings
        with no signs of struggle.
    </p>

    <h2>Strange Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
        Some witnesses describe a reptilian creature with spines along its back, glowing eyes, and long claws.
        Others claim it resembles a hairless canine with unnatural speed and strength.
    </p>

    <h2>A Nocturnal Hunter</h2>
    <p>
        The Chupacabra is believed to hunt under cover of darkness, leaving behind precise wounds and
        completely drained animals — fueling rumors of something far more than a wild predator.
