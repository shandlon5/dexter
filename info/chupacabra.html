        The Chupacabra is often laughed off by new age agraculture investors. To those working in the heat it is a mysterious predator across the Southwest and Latin America,
        blamed for livestock found drained of blood and bearing strange puncture wounds.
        Its name roughly translates to “goat sucker,” though reports describe many victims with various signs of trauma.

        Mexican troops gave reports to leaders of shadows moving between pens at night, followed by silent killings
        with no signs of struggle. Historians would argue this is a helpful story to a hungery group of men.

    <h2>Strange Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
        Some witnesses describe a reptilian creature with spines along its back, glowing eyes, and long claws.

    <p>
        The Chupacabra is believed to hunt under cover of darkness, leaving behind precise wounds and
        completely drained animals — fueling rumors of something far more than a wild predator.
