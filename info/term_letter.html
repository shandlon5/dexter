        <p>To Darnell Mantell,</p>
        <p>Dear Darnell Mantell,
<p>We hope this letter finds you well. It is with regret that we inform you that your position at MIT is hereby terminated, effective immediately. Despite previous warnings regarding the lack of scientific basis in your research and use of time, you have continued to pursue extraterrestrial phenomena. As a result, your recent work has shown a decline in rigor. We can no longer support your endeavors, as we do not consider them academically sound. We wish you the best in your future pursuits.</p>
            
            <p>We must also insist on a formal cease and desist. Your most recent publications are no longer covered under the academic name of MIT, as they fail to meet our standards. Please retract the MIT affiliation from the following papers:

            </p>"Theoretical Pathways from Distant Star Systems and Potential Crash Scenarios of Advanced Civilizations"</p>

<p>"Hypothetical Dimensional Shifting as a Means to Surpass Light-Speed Travel"</p>

<p>"Probability of societal advancement in a post nuclear fission environment"</p>

<p>"Conceptualizing Unmeasurable Forces: A Framework for measuring forces exerted by a soul"</p>

Failure to comply with this request will result in further action. </p>
        <div class="signature">
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Dr. Mary Smith, Dean of Science</p>

        <p>To Darnell Mantell,</p>
        <p>I no longer find it appropriate to offer guidance on these matters. Initially, I engaged with your theoretical questions as intellectual exercises, under the assumption we both treated them as such. However, I fear this has sparked a trajectory for you that I never intended. I am concerned this will lead to your eventual expulsion from MIT. Please return your focus to the assigned research, and set aside notions like untraceable energies across the galaxy.</p>
        <p>Darnell, I believe it is time to put your father’s death behind you and focus on your future. While his passing is tragic, pursuing figments of imagination will only bring you the same fate.</p>
