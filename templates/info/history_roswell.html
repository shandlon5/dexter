    <h1 class="place-title">The Roswell Incident</h1>
    <p class="place-subtitle">History File</p>

    <p class="place-lede">
      In the summer of 1947, something came down outside Roswell, New Mexico.
      Early reports described the recovery of a “flying disc,” a claim that was
      quickly walked back by military officials. Within days, the incident was
      reframed as a mundane weather balloon recovery.
      Those who have studied the case note the speed of the reversal, the volume
      of redactions, and the consistency of witness accounts suggesting advanced,
      unfamiliar materials.
